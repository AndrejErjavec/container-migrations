# Simulation of container migrations in Nion Network
This simulation was created to support testing of new improved implementations of migration algorithm for Nion Network.

Three new algorithms provide the following improvements:
* multiple migrations per block
* improved selection of container to migrate
* usage of standard deviation of CPU usage as a measure for network stability
