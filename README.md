# Simulation of container migrations in Nion Network
This simulation was created to support testing of new improved implementations of migration algorithm for Nion Network.

Three new algorithms deliver the following improvements:
* multiple migrations per block
* improved selection of containers to migrate
* use of standard deviation of CPU usage distribution as a measure of network stability
